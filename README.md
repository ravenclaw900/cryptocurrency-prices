# cryptocurrency-prices
A few scripts to grab cryptocurrency prices and price changes.  I made this as a way to test myself and the programming languages I knew.  So far, there are scripts written in:
- Python
- Bash
- Go
- C++
- Javascript

The Go script is completely standard, the Bash script requires `cURL` and `jq`, the Python script requires `requests` and `json`, the C++ script requires `json-c` and `libcurl`, and the Javascript script requires `TBD`.
